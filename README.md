 Overview:
 Hard
 In this web development assignment, you will create a web-based music player application using
 HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project aims to provide hands-on experience in building a
 user-friendly and interactive music player that can play audio files.
 Project Requirements:
 Your music player should have the following features:
 ● UserInterface: Design a clean and intuitive user interface for the music player. It should
 include controls such as play, pause, volume adjustment, and a progress bar.
 ● AudioPlayback: Implement the ability to play audio files. You can use HTML5's <audio>
 element to handle audio playback.
 ● Playlist: Allow users to create a playlist of songs to play. You can either use a static
 playlist or provide the option for users to add and remove songs dynamically.
 ● Play, Pause, and Seek: Users should be able to play and pause the audio, as well as seek
 to different parts of the song using the progress bar.
 ● VolumeControl: Include a volume control slider to adjust the audio volume.
 ● SongInformation: Display the current song's title, artist, and album information.
 ● Responsive Design: Ensure that your music player is responsive and works well on
 different screen sizes.
 Project Guidelines:
 ● Technologies: Use HTML for structuring the player, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for
 functionality. You can use additional libraries or frameworks if desired.

● AudioFiles: You can either use a set of predefined audio files for your project or provide
 functionality for users to upload and manage their audio files.
 ● UserExperience: Focus on providing a seamless and enjoyable user experience. Make
 sure the user interface is easy to use and visually appealing.
 ● Documentation: Include comments in your code to explain the functionality of various
 components. Also, create a brief document that explains how to use your music player.
